The site allows a user to enter a city and submit. The page will then display the current temperature, wind speed, date, UV index, and humidity with a weather icon. The past cities that have been searched will show up as buttons below the search bar and are clickable to re-display the city information.

The page will also display the 5 day forecast for that city as well with information such as date, icon, temperature, and humidity.
