// create ID's for where to place the elements needed to display. We should already have an input field. 
// We will need to create a #recent-searched field that will display all previous searched so once the search button is clicked
// it displays the current weather to #current-weather as well as display the 5 day information 
// the #recent-searched section should be clickable so the user can search for a previously searched city
// the on click call will need to house a number of items like creating a new row to add the city and also making it an <a> .tag
// so we will need in the JS code add Attr()
// We will also need to make sure the user doesn't hit submit or enter without the city string

// We will also need to create an open var for cityName to be pushed to the empty arr  I guess once the user enters the city
// we might need to create a unique ID to reference it back if the user clicks in the recent searched field.
